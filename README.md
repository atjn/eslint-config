This is my personal JavaScript code style, defined as an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) shareable configuration. My style is:

### Secure
By enforcing best practices, my code becomes much more secure and stable.
### Loosely styled
I have a loosely defined coding style which helps make the code more consistent and readable. I purposefully don't get too specific with small details because I often find that slightly varying my code style can help me write more efficient and readable code.
### Documented
By requiring JSDoc comments for all files and functions, it becomes much easier to read through and understand my code.
