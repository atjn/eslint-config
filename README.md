# My personal JavaScript code style
This is my personal JavaScript code style, defined as an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration. My style is:

## Secure
By enforcing best practices, my code becomes much more secure and stable.
## Loosely styled
I have a loosely defined coding style which helps make the code more consistent and readable. I purposefully don't get too specific about small details because I often find that slightly varying my code style can help me write more efficient and more readable code.
